I am a Robotics Engineer with a background in Biorobotics and Bionics. Over the past year, I have focused my efforts on the humanoid robot iCub at the Italian Institute of Technology, deepening aspects of mechatronics and software development for humanoid robots.

My path is still a book yet to be written, but it is possible to summarize what makes me dream in the following words:

"Looking for the crazy ones, the misfits, the rebels, the troublemakers, the round pegs in the square holes to solve the unsolved problems that will alter the course of human history."
